        <p class="legal-title">4. Security of Information</p>
        <p><b>Information storage and security:</b> We use data hosting service providers in India to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.</p>
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Non-public Personal Information that you share with us will be protected using industry-standard techniques. We seek to protect your non-public Personal Information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee its security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
        <p>Using unsecured or other unprotected networks to use the Service  is not recommended. If 360Katas learns of a security breach, then we may attempt to notify You electronically so that You can take appropriate protective steps.</p>

        <p><b>How long we keep information:</b> How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>
        <p><b>Account information:</b> We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p>
        <p><b>Information you share on the Services:</b> If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow other Service Users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display previous responses you sent to feedback requests.</p>
        <p class="legal-title">5. Request to Delete Information</p>
        <p>Should you ever decide to delete your account and complete information associated with it, you may do so by emailing hi(at)360katas.com. If you terminate your Account, any association between your Account and information we store will no longer be accessible through your Account. However, given the nature of sharing anonymous feedback on the Service, any feedback you shared with others on your Account prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the requestor, in order to not compromise your anonymity..</p>
        <p class="legal-title">6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>
