# 360Katas

360Katas helps users **discover self-development goals** using the **principles of 360 degree feedback methodology**, namely, 
1. Seek **feedback from everyone** around us - Managers, Peers, Subordinates - and not just Managers, and 
2. Encourage the respondents to give **honest feedback** by creating safety of anonymity to them. 

While 360Katas leverages the virtues of 360 degree feedback system it also addresses its challenges like..
1. The inability to ask follow-on questions to any respondent, and 
2. The concern that the feedback may be used for performance appraisal. 

The above problems are addressed by offering the ability to seek clarifications from respondents while maintaining their anonymity, and making the feedback result not accessible by anyone other than the user ie., no one (like HR / Manager) other than the user can view the feedback. 


**Features yet to be built:**
- Implement the app on Microsoft Teams, Google chat, Telegram and on the Web. 
- Create a learning community (on Tribe.so, or Circle.so) where people can meet others like them who are working on similar goals so that they can all work together.  
- Build an AI coach that helps people work towards their self-development goals.
